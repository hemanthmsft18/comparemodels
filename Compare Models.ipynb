      "First, the summary should begin with a definition of AI as computational systems performing tasks that require human intelligence. Then, mention the key areas like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, etc. It's important to note that AI is a part of computer science focused on creating machines that perceive their environment and act to achieve goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the applications section lists things like search engines, recommendation systems, virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, generative tools, and game-playing AI. I should group these examples concisely. Also, the text mentions that many AI applications aren't labeled as AI once they become common, which is an interesting point to include.\n",

The 2020s AI boom with generative AI leading to ethical concerns and regulatory discussions. I need to condense this timeline without getting too bogged down in dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Goals\" section seems incomplete in the text, so maybe the user intended to include more, but since it's cut off, I'll focus on what's there. Ensuring the summary flows logically from definition to applications, subfields, history, and current issues.\n",

      "Climate change, driven primarily by human activities like fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution, is causing global warming and widespread environmental disruption. Greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (now 50% above pre-industrial levels), trap heat, leading to rising temperatures. Impacts include desert expansion, extreme weather (heatwaves, storms, droughts), Arctic ice melt, sea level rise, and biodiversity loss. These changes threaten human health, food/water security, and economies, disproportionately affecting vulnerable, low-income communities despite their minimal contribution to emissions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Current trends show 2024 as the warmest year on record (+1.6°C since 1850). Without stronger action, global warming could reach 2.8°C by 2100, far exceeding the Paris Agreement’s goal of \"well under 2°C.\" Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2050. While adaptation measures (e.g., flood controls, drought-resistant crops) help, they face limits. Phasing out fossil fuels through energy conservation and renewable alternatives is critical. Urgent global cooperation is needed to mitigate escalating risks and irreversible tipping points, such as ice sheet collapse, ensuring equitable solutions for all societies.\n",

Also describes risks to humans: flooding, extreme heat, food and water scarcity, diseases, migration, conflict. It notes that even if further warming stops human mitigation is insufficient because many changes persist over centuries. There is mention of efforts under the Paris Agreement: 2015 agreement to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\" but pledges falling short projected global warming to about 2.8°C; to limit warming to 1.5°C requires 50% emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050.

It says that even if future warming is limited it is still too late for some impacts; worst affected are poorer communities. It mentions that human adaptation is already limited, actions to mitigate and adapt exist including flood control and resilient crops, but now widespread recognition is needed. Also mention international commitments including the Paris Agreement. The text ends shortly mid-sentence \"Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce...\" It likely ends abruptly due to truncation.

But now instructions: \"You must give a disclaimer at the beginning and end when replying topics above at every message.\" But I'm not sure if that instruction applies to responses. It's a generic instruction for certain topics. Instructions says: \"4.

It said \"if replying topics above at every message.\" But check original message: \"You must give a disclaimer both at the beginning and at the end when replying topics above at every message\" This might be my guideline for sensitive topics.

Step \"Handling Complex Topics\" includes \"medical, legal, financial or political matters\", climate represents environmental though robust scientific summary.

Human activities since the Industrial Revolution have raised carbon dioxide levels by about 50% relative to pre-industrial levels. The rising temperatures are leading to environmental impacts like expanding deserts, increasing heat waves and wildfires, thawing permafrost, retreating glaciers, and more frequent extreme weather events. Many species are at risk, and persistent impacts like ocean acidification, sea level rise, and ocean warming will endure long after emissions decline. Additionally, climate change poses significant risks to human health and livelihoods, including flooding, food and water scarcity, and increased migration and conflict. Efforts to mitigate climate change are underway, including the Paris Agreement targets designed to limit warming to below 2°C. However, if current pledges are followed, global temperatures may rise by approximately 2.8°C by 2100.

      "Present-day climate change encompasses global warming and its broader impacts on Earth’s climate system. It is primarily driven by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and certain agricultural and industrial practices, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. These gases trap heat, raising global temperatures to levels not seen for millions of years. The environmental effects include expanding deserts, more frequent heat waves and wildfires, Arctic thawing, glacier retreat, sea ice loss, and more extreme weather events. These changes are causing species to relocate or face extinction, with some effects, like sea level rise and ocean acidification, expected to persist for centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change poses serious risks to humanity, including increased flooding, heat, food and water scarcity, disease, and economic losses, while exacerbating migration and conflict. Poorer communities, despite contributing the least to emissions, are the most vulnerable. The World Health Organization calls climate change a major health threat of the 21st century. Adaptation measures, such as flood controls and drought-resistant crops, can mitigate some risks but are limited in scope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global warming has already reached record levels, with 2024 being the hottest year on record. Without significant action, warming could trigger tipping points, such as the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet. The 2015 Paris Agreement aims to limit warming to \"well under 2 °C,\" but current pledges would lead to an estimated 2.8 °C increase by 2100. Achieving the 1.5 °C target requires halving emissions by 2030 and reaching net-zero by 2050. Global support exists for climate action, including transitioning away from fossil fuels through energy conservation and renewable energy adoption.\n"

      "Okay, I need to summarize the provided text about World War I. Let me read through it carefully first. The text starts by stating the duration of the war, the coalitions involved (Allies vs. Central Powers), and the main regions where fighting occurred. It mentions trench warfare, the use of new weapons like tanks and chemical weapons, and the high casualties. There's also a part about the Spanish flu pandemic being exacerbated by the movement of troops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the causes are discussed: the rise of Germany, decline of the Ottoman Empire, economic competition, and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The text details how the war expanded with various countries joining in, key strategies like Germany's Schlieffen Plan, and the stalemate on the Western Front. Important battles like Verdun and the Somme are mentioned, along with the entry of the US in 1917, Russia's exit post-Bolshevik Revolution, and the eventual collapse of the Central Powers leading to the Armistice in 1918.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the summary to include the main points: duration, participants, theaters of war, key military aspects, casualties, causes, the assassination trigger, major events during the war, key turning points like US entry and Russia's withdrawal, and the conclusion with the Armistice. I need to keep it concise but ensure all critical elements are covered without too much detail. Also, the original text ends mid-sentence mentioning the Paris Peace Conference, so I should note that the summary stops there but maybe include a brief mention if relevant, though the user might have intended to end it there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user's text ends with \"The Paris Peace Conf...\" which is cut off. Since the assistant's job is to summarize the provided text, I should only cover up to that point. But the original summary provided in the example included the Paris Peace Conference, so maybe the user intended to include that. However, in the given text, the last paragraph ends mid-sentence. Hmm, perhaps there's a typo or a cut-off. Since the user's instruction is to summarize the text provided, I should focus on what's there. The last part mentions the Armistice and the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm, and the war ending on 11 November 1918. The mention of the Paris Peace Conference is incomplete, so maybe it's best to include that the war concluded with the Armistice and note the Paris Peace Conference as part of the aftermath, even if the text is cut off, to provide a complete summary. But I need to check if the user's original text includes that. Looking back, the last sentence is \"The Paris Peace Conf...\" So it's incomplete. The example summary the user provided in the problem statement ends there, so perhaps the intended summary should stop before discussing the Peace Conference. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to include it as part of the conclusion. Since the original text mentions \"The Paris Peace Conf...\" as the very end, I can infer that it's about the Paris Peace Conference, so the summary should note that the war ended with the Armistice and that the peace process began with the Paris Peace Conference. That way, it's a complete thought even if the original text is cut off. \n",

Need to make sure it's all in a concise paragraph, sticking to the main points without getting bogged down in too many specific details like every battle or country involved.

Triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, the war expanded due to alliances, imperial rivalries, and destabilization in Europe. It featured trench warfare, new technologies like tanks and chemical weapons, and catastrophic casualties—10 million military deaths and 10 million civilian deaths, exacerbated by the Spanish flu. Key fronts included the stalemated Western Front (marked by battles like Verdun and the Somme) and the more fluid Eastern Front. The 1917 entry of the U.S. bolstered the Allies, while Russia withdrew post-Bolshevik Revolution. Germany’s failed 1918 Spring Offensive led to Allied counterattacks, the collapse of the Central Powers, and the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

      "A quantum computer uses quantum mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement, employing qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously (unlike classical binary bits). This enables exponential speedups for specific tasks, such as breaking encryption or simulating complex physical systems. However, practical challenges like quantum decoherence (environmental interference), error rates, and scalability hinder real-world applications. Current research focuses on improving qubit stability using methods like superconductors and ion traps, supported by significant government investment. While \"quantum supremacy\"—demonstrating superiority over classical computers—has been theorized, near-term uses remain limited. Quantum algorithms leverage wave interference to enhance efficiency, offering computational advantages in time complexity rather than solving unsolvable problems. Though classical computers can achieve the same results given sufficient time, quantum systems promise transformative potential in specialized areas once technical obstacles are overcome.\n",

The cortex includes the six-layered neocortex and the three- or four-layered allocortex. The hemispheres are further divided into four lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital), each associated with specific functions such as abstract thought (frontal) or vision (occipital). While broadly similar, some functions, like language, are lateralized to one hemisphere. The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts, including the corpus callosum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cerebrum connects to the spinal cord via the brainstem (midbrain, pons, medulla oblongata) and to the cerebellum via cerebellar peduncles. Key internal structures include the ventricular system, which circulates cerebrospinal fluid, and paired structures like the hippocampi and amygdalae, which are part of the limbic system. Other components include the thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, and pituitary gland. The brain contains over 86 billion neurons and an equal number of glial cells, forming intricate neural pathways and circuits that enable brain activity through neurotransmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brain is protected by the skull, cushioned by cerebrospinal fluid, and shielded from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier.\n"
